* Create GitHub issues

Post-release
* Push only mode
* Batch insertion
* Don't copy options in README, just use 

Future TODO:
* Fix lint errors
* Ask rxdb to expose types?
* Sync only portion of the table (e.g. a where that will hold true for all rows)
  * Could be implemented with a callback passed in options
  * Better to focus on SupabaseOfflineCache, probably? Well, it's very easy to do though
* Maybe __deleted table in the future?


Future project:
* Build more of a SupabaseOfflineCache that uses only the returned queries as source stream
  for the pull handler. Push would work normally. That way, you don't need to download the
  database ahead of time, but all queried documents will be stored offline and updates will
  get queued. You an also serve queries from cache faster. And you wouldn't need the modified
  and deleted flag necessarily.
  * This would require matching the returned result to the query from the offline db though,
    so we'll need our own query builder (which will be limited to the intersection of what's
    supported by superbase and rxdb)
