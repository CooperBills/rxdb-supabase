Notes:
* JSON fields not supported, need to write your own updateHandler
* Replication ID and the problem around auth / user changes (maybe not really a problem)
* _modified column (if pull is used)
* _deleted column
  * Refer to cleanup plugin. TODO: Will that replicate though, no?
  * TODO: allow to set to null for push-only mode, in which case we don't store it
* Only use null collections :)

Future TODO:
* Fix lint errors
* Ask rxdb to expose types?
* Sync only portion of the table (e.g. a where that will hold true for all rows)
  * Could be implemented with a callback passed in options
  * Better to focus on SupabaseOfflineCache, probably? Well, it's very easy to do though
* Maybe __deleted table in the future?


Future project:
* Build more of a SupabaseOfflineCache that uses only the returned queries as source stream
  for the pull handler. Push would work normally. That way, you don't need to download the
  database ahead of time, but all queried documents will be stored offline and updates will
  get queued. You an also serve queries from cache faster. And you wouldn't need the modified
  and deleted flag necessarily.
  * This would require matching the returned result to the query from the offline db though,
    so we'll need our own query builder (which will be limited to the intersection of what's
    supported by superbase and rxdb)


To run integration tests, set enviornment variables TEST_SUPABASE_URL and TEST_SUPABASE_API_KEY

# Typescript Library Starter

![NPM](https://img.shields.io/npm/l/@gjuchault/typescript-library-starter)
![NPM](https://img.shields.io/npm/v/@gjuchault/typescript-library-starter)
![GitHub Workflow Status](https://github.com/gjuchault/typescript-library-starter/actions/workflows/typescript-library-starter.yml/badge.svg?branch=main)

Yet another (opinionated) typescript library starter template.

## Opinions and limitations

1. Relies as much as possible on each included library's defaults
2. Only rely on GitHub Actions
3. Do not include documentation generation

## Getting started

1. `npx degit gjuchault/typescript-library-starter my-project` or click on `Use this template` button on GitHub!
2. `cd my-project`
3. `npm install`
4. `git init` (if you used degit)
5. `npm run setup`

To enable deployment, you will need to:

1. Setup `NPM_TOKEN` secret in GitHub actions ([Settings > Secrets > Actions](https://github.com/gjuchault/typescript-service-starter/settings/secrets/actions))
2. Give `GITHUB_TOKEN` write permissions for GitHub releases ([Settings > Actions > General](https://github.com/gjuchault/typescript-service-starter/settings/actions) > Workflow permissions)

## Features

### Node.js, npm version

Typescript Library Starter relies on [volta](https://volta.sh/) to ensure node version to be consistent across developers. It's also used in the GitHub workflow file.

### Typescript

Leverages [esbuild](https://github.com/evanw/esbuild) for blazing fast builds, but keeps `tsc` to generate `.d.ts` files.
Generates a single ESM build.

Commands:

- `build`: runs typechecking then ESM and `d.ts` files in the `build/` directory
- `clean`: removes the `build/` directory
- `type:dts`: only generates `d.ts`
- `type:check`: only run typechecking
- `type:build`: only generates ESM

### Tests

typescript-library-starter uses [vitest](https://vitest.dev/). The coverage is done through vitest, using [c8](https://github.com/bcoe/c8).

Commands:

- `test`: runs vitest test runner
- `test:watch`: runs vitest test runner in watch mode
- `test:coverage`: runs vitest test runner and generates coverage reports

### Format & lint

This template relies on the combination of [eslint](https://github.com/eslint/eslint) â€” through [typescript-eslint](https://github.com/typescript-eslint/typescript-eslint) for linting and [prettier](https://github.com/prettier/prettier) for formatting.
It also uses [cspell](https://github.com/streetsidesoftware/cspell) to ensure spelling

Commands:

- `format`: runs prettier with automatic fixing
- `format:check`: runs prettier without automatic fixing (used in CI)
- `lint`: runs eslint with automatic fixing
- `lint:check`: runs eslint without automatic fixing (used in CI)
- `spell:check`: runs spellchecking

### Releasing

Under the hood, this library uses [semantic-release](https://github.com/semantic-release/semantic-release) and [commitizen](https://github.com/commitizen/cz-cli).
The goal is to avoid manual release process. Using `semantic-release` will automatically create a github release (hence tags) as well as an npm release.
Based on your commit history, `semantic-release` will automatically create a patch, feature or breaking release.

Commands:

- `cz`: interactive CLI that helps you generate a proper git commit message, using [commitizen](https://github.com/commitizen/cz-cli)
- `semantic-release`: triggers a release (used in CI)
